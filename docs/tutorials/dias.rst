The Dias (2000) model
=====================

In this tutorial we will explore the parameter space of the SIP model proposed by
`Dias (2000) <https://library.seg.org/doi/10.1190/1.1444738>`_.

This model predicts that the complex resistivity :math:`\rho^*`
of a polarizable rock sample can be described by

.. math::
  \rho^* = \rho_0 \left[ ... \right],

where :math:`\mu = ...`.
