This is because the absence of a clear polarization peak (low values of $c$) can't be explained with Cole-Cole type models, which expect a local maximum in the phase shift spectrum.

    "From this experiment, we learned that the Pelton Cole-Cole model modes are interchangeable, and that to avoid this problem we must fix the $\\log \\tau_k$ parameters to take on boundaries that do not overlap. It also appears that the $m_2$ parameter is often not well resolved because it has accumulated at its upper limit. This implies that even higher values of $m_2$ may explain our data better. However, because $m$ is defined in the interval $[0, 1]$ our results suggest that the Pelton Cole-Cole model may not explain well our data set, especially its high-frequency response. Finally, we saw that data error bars have a high impact of the quality of resolved Cole-Cole parameters, and that weak polarization responses will most certaintly yield ill-defined inversion parameters."
